Hashes are a mathematical function that takes an arbitrary length input and returns a fixed length output like the Fowler-Noll-Vo hash. Cryptographic hash functions are designed with the intention of ensuring that there is as close to one input per output as possible, and that they are incredibly difficult to reverse. There are also hash functions that take a key as well as an input that are, astonishingly, called keyed hash functions. Discourse is still ongoing as to where the name came from. The SHA family of hash functions are cryptographic hashes, and includes both functions that are considered secure today and functions that have been deprecated due to being deemed insecure. 


Let's take a look at how SHA-256 works internally. 
It has a digest length of 256 and is not keyed. SHA-256 takes blocks of 512 bits, and performs 64 rounds per block. 
There are three main steps to this process:
Padding, Block Decomposition, and Hash Computation 

We use a constant 64 binary words:

We will use these later. 
First, we need to pad the information. No matter the length of the input, even if it is a perfect multiple of 512 bits, we pad the input prior to computing our hash. 
There are three steps to the padding:
1. Append a 1 bit
2. Append a number, k, of 0 bits. k is going to be the smaller positive integer where the (inital length of the message) + 1 + k = 448 mod 512
3. Append the length < 2^64 of the inital message with 64 bits to the end of the message

To decompose the block, we seperate the first 16 blocks
