Hashes are a mathematical function that takes an arbitrary length input and returns a fixed length output like the Fowler-Noll-Vo hash. Cryptographic hash functions are designed with the intention of ensuring that there is as close to one input per output as possible, and that they are incredibly difficult to reverse. There are also hash functions that take a key as well as an input that are, astonishingly, called keyed hash functions. Discourse is still ongoing as to where the name came from. The SHA family of hash fucntions are cryptographic hashes, and includes both functions that are considered secure today and functions that have been deprecated due to being deemed insecure. 


Let's take a look at how SHA-256 works internally. 
It has a digest length of 256 and is not keyed. SHA-256 takes blocks of 512 bits, and performs 64 rounds per block. 
There are three main steps to this process:
Padding, Block decomposition, and hash computation 

First, we need to pad the information. No matter the length of the input, even if it is a perfect multiple of 512 bits, we pad the input prior to computing our hash.  We need to ensure that the
